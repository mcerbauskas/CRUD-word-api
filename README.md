# CRUD-word-api
a simple REST'ful API

This is a simple spring boot micro-service created with Maven dependency management tool.
As requested - MySQL wasn't used, so data is stored in a List array.
It is good to use chrome extension "postman" for PUT/DELETE/POST requests.
Palindrome GET functionality isn't ready yet.
